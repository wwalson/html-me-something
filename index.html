                            <h2>Ninja Sex Party</h2>
                            <p>"Three Minutes of Exstacy" and "Orgy for One" are just some of the future classic bangers made by this group.  They are without a doubt the best comdey music act period.  Yes better than your precious Weird Al.  Danny Sexbang & Ninja Brian are each others yin and yang in making beautiful music.  Check them out if you want to hear some good music that will make you laugh</p>

                                <h2>Tupperware Remix Party</h2>
                                <p>From the distant future and the 1980's, comes Tupper Ware Remix Party (TWRP for short).  They are baller and do baller things.  They wear interesting outfits.  But they are a heck of a future funk band.  2nite is probably one of the best albums no one will talk about without knowing if you are cool enough to know if the album exist.  Personally, if you like sounds in your ears, you will like TWRP.</p>

                                <h2>Lucas Joyner</h2>
                                <p>Man'z hot. That's all I need to say.  Lucas Joyner is going to be the future most known unknown.  He remixes every popular rap beat and makes it his own.  He has buzz from his talent and willingness to start beef.  I think in five years everyone will say they were repping him since ten years ago.  He can introspective and ask the real questions and the next second lyrically rip bar for bar with each breath.   If you want to have faith in rap again, Lucas Joyner is your Moses.</p>
